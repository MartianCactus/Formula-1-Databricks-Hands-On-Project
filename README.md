Although it says 20 hours, it took me upwards of 100 hours to actually complete the certification due to extensively documenting every concept and step along with many blockers and issues that arose due to the majority of the course being made during the Legacy Hive Metastore era, and me completing it with a Unity Catalog enabled workspace. I had to solve a lot of these blockers myself, leading to huge tangents, but I was able to solve all of them in the end, and feel extremely satisfied !
